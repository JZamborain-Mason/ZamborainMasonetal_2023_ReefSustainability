# Zamborain-Masonetal_2023_ReefSustainability
This repository contains the code to implement the analyses from the manuscript titled "Sustainable reference points for multispecies coral reef fisheries" (Zamborain-Mason et al. 2023).

For the main analyses we used the RSTAN package. To account for methodological effects in our ecosystem response variables we used the brms package. Additional packages were used to re-arrange the data, check model fit and for plotting purposes. All analyses were implemented in R (R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23)).
